Admins and developers often configure IIS to connect to backend systems — databases, SMTP servers, or UNC file shares. To make that work, they save credentials inside those XML configs.


Internet Information Services (IIS) is the default web server on Windows installations. The configuration of websites on IIS is stored in a file called `web.config` and can store passwords for databases or configured authentication mechanisms. Depending on the installed version of IIS, we can find web.config in one of the following locations:

- C:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config
- C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config

Here is a quick way to find database connection strings on the file:

```shell-session
type C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config | findstr connectionString
```
