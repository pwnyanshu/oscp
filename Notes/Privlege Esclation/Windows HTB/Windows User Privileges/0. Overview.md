## User Rights Assignment

|Setting [Constant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/privilege-constants)|Setting Name|Standard Assignment|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|SeNetworkLogonRight|[Access this computer from the network](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/access-this-computer-from-the-network)|Administrators, Authenticated Users|Determines which users can connect to the device from the network. This is required by network protocols such as SMB, NetBIOS, CIFS, and COM+.|
|SeRemoteInteractiveLogonRight|[Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/allow-log-on-through-remote-desktop-services)|Administrators, Remote Desktop Users|This policy setting determines which users or groups can access the login screen of a remote device through a Remote Desktop Services connection. A user can establish a Remote Desktop Services connection to a particular server but not be able to log on to the console of that same server.|
|SeBackupPrivilege|[Back up files and directories](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/back-up-files-and-directories)|Administrators|This user right determines which users can bypass file and directory, registry, and other persistent object permissions for the purposes of backing up the system.|
|SeSecurityPrivilege|[Manage auditing and security log](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/manage-auditing-and-security-log)|Administrators|This policy setting determines which users can specify object access audit options for individual resources such as files, Active Directory objects, and registry keys. These objects specify their system access control lists (SACL). A user assigned this user right can also view and clear the Security log in Event Viewer.|
|SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege|[Take ownership of files or other objects](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/take-ownership-of-files-or-other-objects)|Administrators|This policy setting determines which users can take ownership of any securable object in the device, including Active Directory objects, NTFS files and folders, printers, registry keys, services, processes, and threads.|
|SeDebugPrivilege|[Debug programs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/debug-programs)|Administrators|This policy setting determines which users can attach to or open any process, even a process they do not own. Developers who are debugging their applications do not need this user right. Developers who are debugging new system components need this user right. This user right provides access to sensitive and critical operating system components.|
|SeImpersonatePrivilege|[Impersonate a client after authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/impersonate-a-client-after-authentication)|Administrators, Local Service, Network Service, Service|This policy setting determines which programs are allowed to impersonate a user or another specified account and act on behalf of the user.|
|SeLoadDriverPrivilege|[Load and unload device drivers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/load-and-unload-device-drivers)|Administrators|This policy setting determines which users can dynamically load and unload device drivers. This user right is not required if a signed driver for the new hardware already exists in the driver.cab file on the device. Device drivers run as highly privileged code.|
|SeRestorePrivilege|[Restore files and directories](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/restore-files-and-directories)|Administrators|This security setting determines which users can bypass file, directory, registry, and other persistent object permissions when they restore backed up files and directories. It determines which users can set valid security principals as the owner of an object.|
|SeTcbPrivilege|[Act as part of the operating system](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/act-as-part-of-the-operating-system)|Administrators, Local Service, Network Service, Service|This security setting determines whether a process can assume the identity of any user and, through this, obtain access to resources that the targeted user is permitted to access (impersonation). This may be assigned to antivirus or backup tools that need the ability to access all system files for scans or backups. This privilege should be reserved for service accounts requiring this access for legitimate activities.|

whoami /priv

# give you a listing of all user rights assigned to your current user
```

When a privilege is listed for our account in the `Disabled` state, it means that our account has the specific privilege assigned. Still, it cannot be used in an access token to perform the associated actions until it is enabled. Windows does not provide a built-in command or PowerShell cmdlet to enable privileges, so we need some scripting to help us out. We will see ways to abuse various privileges throughout this module and various ways to enable specific privileges within our current process. One example is this PowerShell [script](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PoshPrivilege/0.3.0.0/Content/Scripts%5CEnable-Privilege.ps1) which can be used to enable certain privileges, or this [script](https://www.leeholmes.com/adjusting-token-privileges-in-powershell/) which can be used to adjust token privileges.
