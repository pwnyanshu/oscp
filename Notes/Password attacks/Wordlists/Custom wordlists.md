It becomes significantly more challenging to apply old techniques to systems that require users to create more complex passwords.

But many employees choose passwords that include the company's name. Personal preferences and interests also play a significant role—these may include references to pets, friends, sports, hobbies, and other aspects of daily life. Basic OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) techniques can be highly effective in uncovering such personal information and may assist in password guessing.

A system might enforce the inclusion of uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers. Most password policies mandate a minimum length—typically eight characters—and require at least one character from each specified category.

Commonly, users use the following additions for their password to fit the most common password policies:

| **Description**                       | **Password Syntax** |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| First letter is uppercase             | `Password`          |
| Adding numbers                        | `Password123`       |
| Adding year                           | `Password2022`      |
| Adding month                          | `Password02`        |
| Last character is an exclamation mark | `Password2022!`     |
| Adding special characters             | `P@ssw0rd2022!`     |
According to statistics provided by [WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/resources/passwords-unmasked-infographic/), most passwords are no longer than `ten` characters. One approach is to select familiar terms that are at least five characters long—such as pet names, hobbies, personal preferences, or other common interests. For instance, if a user selects a single word (e.g., the current month), appends the current year, and adds a special character at the end, the result may satisfy a typical ten-character password requirement. Considering that most organizations require regular password changes, a user might modify their password by simply changing the name of the month or incrementing a single digit.

Let's look at a simple example using a password list with only one entry.

```
cat password.list password
````
We can use Hashcat to combine lists of potential names and labels with specific mutation rules to create custom wordlists. Hashcat uses a specific syntax to define characters, words, and their transformations. The complete syntax is documented in the official [Hashcat rule-based attack documentation](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=rule_based_attack), but the examples below are sufficient to understand how Hashcat mutates input words.

|**Function**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`:`|Do nothing|
|`l`|Lowercase all letters|
|`u`|Uppercase all letters|
|`c`|Capitalize the first letter and lowercase others|
|`sXY`|Replace all instances of X with Y|
|`$!`|Add the exclamation character at the end|

Each rule is written on a new line and determines how a given word should be transformed. If we write the functions shown above into a file, it may look like this:

```
cat custom.rule 

: 
c 
so0 
c so0 
sa@ 
c sa@ 
c sa@ so0 
$! 
$! c 
$! so0 
$! sa@ 
$! c so0 
$! c sa@ 
$! so0 sa@ 
$! c so0 sa@
````

We can use the following command to apply the rules in `custom.rule` to each word in `password.list` and store the mutated results in `mut_password.list`.

```
hashcat --force password.list -r custom.rule --stdout | sort -u > mut_password.list
````

In this case, the single input word will produce fifteen mutated variants.

```
cat mut_password.list 

password 
Password 
passw0rd 
Passw0rd 
p@ssword 
P@ssword 
P@ssw0rd 
password! 
Password! 
passw0rd! 
p@ssword! 
Passw0rd! 
P@ssword! 
p@ssw0rd! 
P@ssw0rd!`
```

Hashcat and JtR both come with pre-built rule lists that can be used for password generation and cracking. One of the most effective and widely used rulesets is `best64.rule`, which applies common transformations that frequently result in successful password guesses.
One I love is OneRuleToRuleThemAll.rule

It is important to note that password cracking and the creation of custom wordlists are, in most cases, a guessing game. We can narrow this down and perform more targeted guessing if we have information about the password policy, while considering factors such as the company name, geographical region, industry, and other topics or keywords that users might choose when creating their passwords.

## Generating wordlists using CeWL

We can use a tool called [CeWL](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL) to scan potential words from a company's website and save them in a separate list. We can then combine this list with the desired rules to create a customized password list—one that has a higher probability of containing the correct password for an employee. We specify some parameters, like the depth to spider (`-d`), the minimum length of the word (`-m`), the storage of the found words in lowercase (`--lowercase`), as well as the file where we want to store the results (`-w`).

 ```
 cewl https://www.inlanefreight.com -d 4 -m 6 --lowercase -w inlane.wordlist 
 
 wc -l inlane.wordlist 
 
 326
 ```
