SMB is commonly used in Windows networks, and we will often find share folders in a Windows network.

### Windows

#### CLI
On Windows GUI, we can press `[WINKEY] + [R]` to open the Run dialog box and type the file share location, e.g.: `\\192.168.220.129\Finance\`

Suppose the shared folder allows anonymous authentication, or we are authenticated with a user who has privilege over that shared folder. In that case, we will not receive any form of authentication request, and it will display the content of the shared folder.

If we do not have access, we will receive an authentication request.

#### CMD
```shell
# Directory Listing
dir \\192.168.220.129\Finance\
```

The command [net use](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/gg651155\(v=ws.11\)) connects a computer to or disconnects a computer from a shared resource or displays information about computer connections. We can connect to a file share with the following command and map its content to the drive letter `n`.

```cmd-session
net use n: \\192.168.220.129\Finance

net use n: \\192.168.220.129\Finance /user:plaintext Password123
```
