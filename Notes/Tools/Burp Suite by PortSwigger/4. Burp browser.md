if you are running Burp Suite on Linux as the root user (as is the case with the AttackBox), you may encounter an error preventing the Burp Browser from starting due to the inability to create a sandbox environment.

There are two simple solutions to this:

1. **Smart option:** Create a new user and run Burp Suite under a low-privilege account to allow the Burp Browser to run without issues.
2. **Easy option:** Go to `Settings -> Tools -> Burp's browser` and check the `Allow Burp's browser to run without a sandbox` option. Enabling this option will allow the browser to start without a sandbox. However, please be aware that this option is disabled by default for security reasons. If you choose to enable it, exercise caution, as compromising the browser could grant an attacker access to your entire machine. In the training environment of the AttackBox, this is unlikely to be a significant issue, but use it responsibly.
