Repeater is particularly well-suited for tasks requiring repetitive sending of similar requests, typically with minor modifications. This is particularly useful for activities such as manual testing for SQL Injection vulnerabilities (to be covered in a forthcoming task), attempting to bypass web application firewall filters, or adjusting parameters in a form submission.

While manual request crafting is an option, it is more common to capture a request using the Proxy module and subsequently transmit it to Repeater for further editing and resending.

Once a request has been captured in the Proxy module, we can send it to Repeater by either right-clicking on the request and selecting **Send to Repeater**, or by utilizing the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + R`.

Shifting our focus back to Repeater, we can observe that our captured request is now accessible in the Request view:

Both the Target and Inspector sections now display relevant information, albeit we are currently lacking a response. Upon clicking the **Send** button, the Response view swiftly populates:

Should we wish to modify any aspect of the request, we can simply type within the Request view and press **Send** once again. This action will update the Response view on the right accordingly. For instance, altering the **Connection** header to "open" instead of "close" yields a response with a **Connection** header containing the value "keep-alive":

Furthermore, we can utilize the history buttons situated to the right of the Send button to navigate through our modification history, allowing us to move forward or backwards as needed.
