## Enumeration

We can understand how a company operates and the services they provide, as well as third-party service providers like emails.

```bash
nmap -p53 -Pn -sV -sC 10.10.110.213
```

## DNS Zone Transfer

A **DNS zone transfer** is when one DNS server copies the **entire contents (or changes) of a DNS zone** from another DNS server.

There are two main types:

- **AXFR (Full zone transfer)**: dumps **everything**—all records, all hosts, all subdomains.
- **IXFR (Incremental zone transfer)**: copies **only what changed** since last time.

```shell-session
 dig AXFR @ns1.inlanefreight.htb inlanefreight.htb
 
# The @ means: “Use this DNS server, not my system default resolver.”
# inlanefreight.htb: Give me the entire DNS zone for `inlanefreight.htb`.
```

OR

```shell-session
fierce --domain zonetransfer.me
```

## Domain Takeovers & Subdomain Enumeration

`Domain takeover` is registering a non-existent domain name to gain control over another domain. If attackers find an expired domain, they can claim that domain to perform further attacks such as hosting malicious content on a website or sending a phishing email leveraging the claimed domain.

### Sub-Domain takeover

A DNS's canonical name (`CNAME`) record is used to map different domains to a parent domain. Many organizations use third-party services like AWS, GitHub, Akamai, Fastly, and other content delivery networks (CDNs) to host their content. In this case, they usually create a subdomain and make it point to those services. For example,

```shell-session
sub.target.com.   60   IN   CNAME   anotherdomain.com
```

The domain name (e.g., `sub.target.com`) uses a CNAME record to another domain (e.g., `anotherdomain.com`). Suppose the `anotherdomain.com` expires and is available for anyone to claim the domain since the `target.com`'s DNS server has the `CNAME` record. In that case, anyone who registers `anotherdomain.com` will have complete control over `sub.target.com` until the DNS record is updated.

#### Subdomain Enumeration

Before performing a subdomain takeover, we should enumerate subdomains for a target domain using tools like [Subfinder](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder). This tool can scrape subdomains from open sources like [DNSdumpster](https://dnsdumpster.com/). Other tools like [Sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r) can also be used to brute-force subdomains by supplying a pre-generated wordlist:

```shell-session
./subfinder -d inlanefreight.com -v
```

#### Subbrute

An excellent alternative is a tool called [Subbrute](https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute). This tool allows us to use self-defined resolvers and perform pure DNS brute-forcing attacks during internal penetration tests on hosts that do not have Internet access.

```shell-session
git clone https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute.git >> /dev/null 2>&1
cd subbrute
echo "ns1.inlanefreight.com" > ./resolvers.txt
./subbrute.py inlanefreight.com -s ./names.txt -r ./resolvers.txt
```

The tool has found four subdomains associated with `inlanefreight.com`. Using the `nslookup` or `host` command, we can enumerate the `CNAME` records for those subdomains.

  Attacking DNS

```shell-session
host support.inlanefreight.com

support.inlanefreight.com is an alias for inlanefreight.s3.amazonaws.com
```

The `support` subdomain has an alias record pointing to an AWS S3 bucket. However, the URL `https://support.inlanefreight.com` shows a `NoSuchBucket` error indicating that the subdomain is potentially vulnerable to a subdomain takeover. Now, we can take over the subdomain by creating an AWS S3 bucket with the same subdomain name.

![XML error: NoSuchBucket. Message: The specified bucket 'inlanefreight' does not exist. Includes RequestId and HostId.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/116/s3.png)

The [can-i-take-over-xyz](https://github.com/EdOverflow/can-i-take-over-xyz) repository is also an excellent reference for a subdomain takeover vulnerability. It shows whether the target services are vulnerable to a subdomain takeover and provides guidelines on assessing the vulnerability.

## DNS Spoofing / DNS Cache Poisoning

Example attack paths for the DNS Cache Poisoning are as follows:

- An attacker could intercept the communication between a user and a DNS server to route the user to a fraudulent destination instead of a legitimate one by performing a Man-in-the-Middle (`MITM`) attack.
- Exploiting a vulnerability found in a DNS server could yield control over the server by an attacker to modify the DNS records.

#### Local DNS Cache Poisoning

From a local network perspective, an attacker can also perform DNS Cache Poisoning using MITM tools like [Ettercap](https://www.ettercap-project.org/) or [Bettercap](https://www.bettercap.org/).

To exploit the DNS cache poisoning via `Ettercap`, we should first edit the `/etc/ettercap/etter.dns` file to map the target domain name (e.g., `inlanefreight.com`) that they want to spoof and the attacker's IP address (e.g., `192.168.225.110`) that they want to redirect a user to:

  Attacking DNS

```shell-session
hellopriyanshu2702@htb[/htb]# cat /etc/ettercap/etter.dns

inlanefreight.com      A   192.168.225.110
*.inlanefreight.com    A   192.168.225.110
```

Next, start the `Ettercap` tool and scan for live hosts within the network by navigating to `Hosts > Scan for Hosts`. Once completed, add the target IP address (e.g., `192.168.152.129`) to Target1 and add a default gateway IP (e.g., `192.168.152.2`) to Target2.

![Ettercap interface showing host list with IP and MAC addresses. Highlighted entry: IP 192.168.152.129, MAC 00:0C:29:A7:9D:13. Options to delete or add host to targets.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/116/target.png)

Activate `dns_spoof` attack by navigating to `Plugins > Manage Plugins`. This sends the target machine with fake DNS responses that will resolve `inlanefreight.com` to IP address `192.168.225.110`:

![Ettercap plugins list showing dns_spoof version 1.3, highlighted. Info: Sends spoofed DNS replies. Host 192.168.152.129 added to TARGET1.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/116/etter_plug.png)

After a successful DNS spoof attack, if a victim user coming from the target machine `192.168.152.129` visits the `inlanefreight.com` domain on a web browser, they will be redirected to a `Fake page` that is hosted on IP address `192.168.225.110`:

![Browser window displaying URL 'http://inlanefreight.com/' with text 'Fake page' on a blank webpage](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/116/etter_site.png)

In addition, a ping coming from the target IP address `192.168.152.129` to `inlanefreight.com` should be resolved to `192.168.225.110` as well:
