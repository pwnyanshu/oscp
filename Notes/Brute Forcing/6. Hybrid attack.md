Policies requiring users to change their passwords periodically to enhance security
But here we start seeing patterns like Summer2023 -> Summer2024 -> Summer2024! -> and so on

#### What's Hybrid attack

They leverage the strengths of both dictionary and brute-force techniques, maximizing the chances of cracking passwords

---

The attacker starts by - 

Dictionary attack using
- Common Passwords
- industry-specific terms
- potentially personal information related to the organization or its employees

However, if the dictionary attack proves unsuccessful, the hybrid attack seamlessly transitions into a brute-force mode. Instead of randomly generating password combinations, it strategically modifies the words from the original wordlist, appending numbers, special characters, or even incrementing years, as in our "Summer2023" example.

The effectiveness of hybrid attacks lies in their adaptability and efficiency. They leverage the strengths of both dictionary and brute-force techniques, maximizing the chances of cracking passwords, especially in scenarios where users fall into predictable patterns.

Let's consider a scenario where you have access to a common passwords wordlist, and you're targeting an organization with the following password policy:

- Minimum length: 8 characters
- Must include:
    - At least one uppercase letter
    - At least one lowercase letter
	- At least one number

We can use `grep`to filter out the passwords according to our requirement

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/refs/heads/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/darkweb2017_top-10000.txt
# Download a common wordlist

grep -E '^.{8,}$' darkweb2017-top10000.txt > darkweb2017-minlength.txt
# Get all the files with at 8 characters

grep -E '[A-Z]' darkweb2017-minlength.txt > darkweb2017-uppercase.txt
# Atleast one Uppercase

grep -E '[a-z]' darkweb2017-uppercase.txt > darkweb2017-lowercase.txt
# Atleast one lower case

grep -E '[0-9]' darkweb2017-lowercase.txt > darkweb2017-number.txt
# Atleast one number
```

Don't forget to use the same passwords in other applications.
