PHP SQL Connection
```php
$conn = new mysqli("localhost", "root", "password", "users");
$query = "select * from logins";
$result = $conn->query($query);
```

Print all returned results of the SQL query in new lines:
```php
while($row = $result->fetch_assoc() ){
	echo $row["name"]."<br>";
}
```

---

Backend sql logic looks like this
```php
$searchInput =  $_POST['findUser'];
$query = "select * from logins where username like '%$searchInput'";
$result = $conn->query($query);
```

---
## SQL Injection

```php
$searchInput =  $_POST['findUser'];
$query = "select * from logins where username like '%$searchInput'";
$result = $conn->query($query);
```

```sql
select * from logins where username like '%$searchInput'
```

Lets inject
```php
'%1'; DROP TABLE users; --
```
`Once the query is run, the` users `table will get deleted.`

## Types of SQL Injections
![[Pasted image 20251130122424.png]]

**In-band**: Output is printed in front end
-  Union Based: we may have to specify the exact location, 'i.e., column', which we can read, so the query will direct the output to be printed there
- Error Based: we can get the `PHP` or `SQL` errors in the front-end, and so we may intentionally cause an SQL error that returns the output of our query

**Blind**: Output is not printed on the screen
- Boolean: With `Boolean Based` SQL injection, we can use SQL conditional statements to control whether the page returns any output at all, 'i.e., original query response,' if our conditional statement returns `true`.
- Time Based: we use SQL conditional statements that delay the page response if the conditional statement returns `true` using the `Sleep()` function.

**Out-of-band**: Finally, in some cases, we may not have direct access to the output whatsoever, so we may have to direct the output to a remote location, 'i.e., DNS record,' and then attempt to retrieve it from there.
