```sql
SELECT * FROM ports;

SELECT * FROM ports;

SELECT * FROM ports UNION SELECT * FROM ships;

-- Note:
-- 1. Both of them should have the same number of columns
-- 2. Datatypes should be same of respective columns
-- 3. You may use NULL 
```


## Un-even Columns
```sql
mysql> SELECT * from products where product_id UNION SELECT username, 2, 3, 4 from passwords-- '

OR WHY NOT

mysql> SELECT * from products where product_id UNION SELECT username, NULL, NULL, NULL from passwords-- '

+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| product_1 | product_2 | product_3 | product_4 |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
|   admin   |    2      |    3      |    4      |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
```

Example:

```sql
select * from employees union select null,null,dept_name,dept_no,null,null from departments;
```
