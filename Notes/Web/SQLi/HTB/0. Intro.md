First, the attacker has to inject code outside the expected user input limits, so it does not get executed as simple user input. In the most basic case, this is done by injecting a single quote (`'`) or a double quote (`"`) to escape the limits of user input and inject data directly into the SQL query.

SQL injection happens in relational database and won't happen in a NoSQL database.

SQL = the language.  
MySQL = one database that uses that language.

SQL can be used to perform the following actions:
- Retrieve data
- Update data
- Delete data
- Create new tables and databases
- Add / remove users
- Assign permissions to these users
