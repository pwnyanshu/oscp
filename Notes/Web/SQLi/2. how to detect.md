- The single quote character `'` and look for errors or other anomalies.
- Some SQL-specific syntax that evaluates to the base (original) value of the entry point, and to a different value, and look for systematic differences in the application responses.
- Boolean conditions such as `OR 1=1` and `OR 1=2`, and look for differences in the application's responses.
- Payloads designed to trigger time delays when executed within a SQL query, and look for differences in the time taken to respond.
- OAST payloads designed to trigger an out-of-band network interaction when executed within a SQL query, and monitor any resulting interactions.


## SQL injection in different parts of the query

Most SQL injection vulnerabilities occur within the `WHERE` clause of a `SELECT` query. Most experienced testers are familiar with this type of SQL injection.

However, SQL injection vulnerabilities can occur at any location within the query, and within different query types. Some other common locations where SQL injection arises are:

- In `UPDATE` statements, within the updated values or the `WHERE` clause.
- In `INSERT` statements, within the inserted values.
- In `SELECT` statements, within the table or column name.
- In `SELECT` statements, within the `ORDER BY` clause.
