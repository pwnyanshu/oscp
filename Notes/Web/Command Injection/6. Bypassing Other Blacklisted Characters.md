### Linux

See all the available environment variables
```shell
printenv
```

---
see the content of path variable
```shell-session
echo ${PATH}
```

---
prints a slash
```shell-session
echo ${PATH:0:1}
```

---
prints a semicolon
```shell-session
echo ${LS_COLORS:10:1}
```

---
WE CAN PLAY AROUND WITH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES, TO GET ANY DESIRED CHARACTER

---
---

### Windows

CMD: Prints a slash
```cmd-session
echo %HOMEPATH:~6,-11%
```

---
POWERSHELL: Prints a slash
```powershell-session
$env:HOMEPATH[0]
```

---
POWERSHELL: Prints a space
```powershell-session
$env:PROGRAMFILES[10]
```

---
We can also use the `Get-ChildItem Env:` PowerShell command to print all environment variables and then pick one of them to produce a character we need. `Try to be creative and find different commands to produce similar characters.`

### Character shifting

This will just shift the characters so instead of printing \[ it prints a \\
```shell-session
echo $(tr '!-}' '"-~'<<<[)
```

Powershell scripts can be too lengthy
