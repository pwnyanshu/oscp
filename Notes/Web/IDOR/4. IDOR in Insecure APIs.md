While `IDOR Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities` allow us to read various types of resources, `IDOR Insecure Function Calls` enable us to call APIs or execute functions as another user. Such functions and APIs can be used to change another user's private information, reset another user's password, or even buy items using another user's payment information. In many cases, we may be obtaining certain information through an information disclosure IDOR vulnerability and then using this information with IDOR insecure function call vulnerabilities, as we will see later in the module.
