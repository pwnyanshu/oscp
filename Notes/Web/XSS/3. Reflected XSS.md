There are two types of `Non-Persistent XSS` vulnerabilities: `Reflected XSS`, which gets processed by the back-end server, and `DOM-based XSS`, which is completely processed on the client-side and never reaches the back-end server. Unlike Persistent XSS, `Non-Persistent XSS` vulnerabilities are temporary and are not persistent through page refreshes. Hence, our attacks only affect the targeted user and will not affect other users who visit the page.

How can we use this to attack a victim?
if the website gets the parameter as GET, send them the URL with the payload.

As we can see, the first row shows that our request was a `GET` request. `GET` request sends their parameters and data as part of the URL. So, `to target a user, we can send them a URL containing our payload`. To get the URL, we can copy the URL from the URL bar in Firefox after sending our XSS payload, or we can right-click on the `GET` request in the `Network` tab and select `Copy>Copy URL`. Once the victim visits this URL, the XSS payload would execute:

Payloads

```javascript
<script>alert(window.origin)</script>

<plaintext>

<script>print()</script>

<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

<img src="" onerror=alert(window.origin)>
```
