This do not even go to the server, runs totally on the client machine.

To target a user with this DOM XSS vulnerability, we can once again copy the URL from the browser and share it with them, and once they visit it, the JavaScript code should execute.

If we try the XSS payload we have been using previously, we will see that it will not execute. This is because the `innerHTML` function does not allow the use of the `<script>` tags within it as a security feature. Still, there are many other XSS payloads we use that do not contain `<script>` tags, like the following XSS payload:

Code: html

```html
<img src="" onerror=alert(window.origin)>
```
