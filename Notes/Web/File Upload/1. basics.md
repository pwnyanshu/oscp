if
client side filtering is applied then we can just look at the source code and by pass it
but if 
server side filtering is applied then Uploading files designed to provoke errors can help with this. Tools like Burpsuite or OWASP Zap can be very helpful at this stage.


## Identify the web framework

For example, when we visit our exercise below, we see its URL as `http://SERVER_IP:PORT/`, as the `index` page is usually hidden by default. But, if we try visiting `http://SERVER_IP:PORT/index.php`, we would get the same page, which means that this is indeed a `PHP` web application. We do not need to do this manually, of course, as we can use a tool like Burp Intruder for fuzzing the file extension using a [Web Extensions](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt) wordlist, as we will see in upcoming sections. This method may not always be accurate, though, as the web application may not utilize index pages or may utilize more than one web extension.

Several other techniques may help identify the technologies running the web application, like using the [Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/) extension, which is available for all major browsers. Once added to our browser, we can click its icon to view all technologies running the web application

We may also run web scanners to identify the web framework, like Burp/ZAP scanners or other Web Vulnerability Assessment tools. In the end, once we identify the language running the web application, we may upload a malicious script written in the same language to exploit the web application and gain remote control over the back-end server.
