Without filtering we get result like

However, as we saw in our previous run of `ffuf`, we can get many responses with code `200`. So, in this case, we will have to filter the results based on another factor, which we will learn in this section.

In this case, we cannot use matching, as we don't know what the response size from other VHosts would be. We know the response size of the incorrect results, which, as seen from the test above, is `986`, and we can filter it out with `-fs 986`. Now, let's repeat the same previous command, add the above flag, and see what we get:

```
# -fs = filter by size

ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u http://academy.htb:36550/ -H 'Host: FUZZ.academy.htb' -fs 986
```
