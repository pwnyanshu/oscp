### Extension Fuzzing

We must find out what types of pages the website uses, like `.html`, `.aspx`, `.php`, or something else.

One common way to identify that is by finding the server type through the HTTP response headers and guessing the extension. For example, if the server is `apache`, then it may be `.php`, or if it was `IIS`, then it could be `.asp` or `.aspx`, and so on.

However, there is one file we can always find in most websites, which is `index.*`, so we will use it as our file and fuzz extensions on it.

```
locate web-extensions.txt
```

### Recursive Fuzzing

So far, we have been fuzzing for directories, then going under these directories, and then fuzzing for files. However, if we had dozens of directories, each with their own subdirectories and files, this would take a very long time to complete. To be able to automate this, we will utilize what is known as `recursive fuzzing`.

```
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://94.237.120.230:34866/FUZZ -recursion -recursion-depth 1 -e .php -v 


ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/FUZZ -recursion -recursion-depth 1 -e .php -v

# -v to output the full URLs
# -e for extionsion to be used
# control the depth using -recusion_depth
```
