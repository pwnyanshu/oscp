Some of the most commonly used wordlists can be found under the GitHub [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) repository

The specific wordlist we will be utilizing for pages and directory fuzzing is another commonly used wordlist called `directory-list-2.3`

```shell-session
locate directory-list-2.3-small.txt
```
